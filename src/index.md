      <h2>Formal verification powered by custom compilers and LLMs</h2>
      <p class="lede">We design custom compilers and combine them with LLM-driven proof assistants to formally verify critical software—reducing bugs, eliminating undefined behaviour, and creating provable guarantees for production systems.</p>
      <p class="meta">Suitable for safety-critical systems, financial contracts, crypto primitives, and any code that must be correct by construction.</p>

## Services

### Compiler engineering
We build custom compilers that preserve semantics and emit verification-friendly IR for downstream proof tools.

### LLM-powered proofs
We harness large language models as assistants to generate and structure proofs, backed by automatic proof checking.

### Verification pipelines
From specification to reproducible CI: we deliver pipelines that integrate with your workflow and provide guardrails for ongoing changes.

## Our approach

<ol>
  <li>Capture a precise formal specification for your system.</li>
  <li>Design/modify a compiler that preserves the spec into verifiable IR.</li>
  <li>Use LLMs to propose proof steps, then discharge them with automated proof-checkers.</li>
  <li>Integrate results into CI so proofs stay green as code evolves.</li>
</ol>

## About VerifyAI

VerifyAI brings together compiler theory, formal methods, and the latest LLM techniques to make formal verification practical for real-world codebases. We specialize in crafting toolchains and workflows that deliver provable guarantees without slowing product velocity.
